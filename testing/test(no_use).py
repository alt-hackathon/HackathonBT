    "ftp": {
        "reason": "FTP sends data unencrypted, exposing usernames and passwords.",
        "recommendation": "Use SFTP or FTPS instead for secure file transfers."

        "reason": "Older versions of SMB are vulnerable to remote code execution (e.g. EternalBlue).",
        "recommendation": "Update to SMBv3 and block SMB traffic over the internet."

        "reason": "RDP is a common target for brute-force and ransomware attacks.",
        "recommendation": "Use a VPN and enable Network Level Authentication (NLA)."

        "reason": "VNC is often exposed without encryption or strong passwords.",
        "recommendation": "Tunnel VNC over SSH or use a secure alternative like Guacamole with MFA."
    },

        "reason": "Exposing MySQL to the network can allow database access if not properly secured.",
        "recommendation": "Bind MySQL to localhost and use firewalls to restrict access."
    },
    "mongodb": {
        "reason": "Old MongoDB setups often have no authentication, allowing public read/write access.",
        "recommendation": "Enable authentication and firewall off external access."
    },
    "http": {
        "reason": "Unencrypted HTTP can leak sensitive data and session tokens.",
        "recommendation": "Redirect HTTP to HTTPS using SSL certificates."
